- play with python concurrency
- create random numbers and merge them at a central thing; whats the overhead?
- benefit from reducing/blocking to the number of processors?
- what about printing a nice chart of process times?
- threadpool means we only have 2 workers at a time?
- how does consumption of answers work? when do those things get scheduled?
    - we should be able to put all this in the library
question from fluent python:
How easy would it be to make am async map that collects out of order, as results finish?
- switch between threadpool and process pool. big diff?
- do pools partition a head of time? or dynamically as they get free?
